# Collaboration
I did not discuss with anyone. 

# Discussion
Challenges: My biggest challenge was implementing the compare function pointers. Another challenge was tracking all memory leaks as l wrote many lines of
code. The past challenge was debugging and identifying memory leaks as the code lines became many.  
Question: A better data structure than an array will be a HashMap because it allows us to use the key-value feature to easily retrieve pirate information
i.e name can be the key and the value will be the actual name of the pirate. This will ensure fast insertion and retrieval of data.
