| 10/03 |      06:00pm |       6:00 | read assignment, understood the assignment and wrote the implementation files i.e pirate.c, pirate_list.c     |

# Collaboration
I did not discuss with anyone. 

# Discussion
My biggest challenge was reading the data from the file into the structs. 
I also struggled with memory management since l got a lot of segmentation faults.
