I did not discuss with anyone. 

# Discussion
Taking the second command-line argument of 1s and 0s and putting it into an array.   
Getting used to C syntax was also a challenge at first because l was confusing Python with C syntax, but l later got used to it.   
The last challenge was checking if the user has put a valid first command-line argument.
