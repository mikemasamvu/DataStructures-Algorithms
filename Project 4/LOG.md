| 11/01 |      09:00pm |       4:00 | wrote my gmap functions and debugged all the errors using gmap test cases                                  |  
| 11/03 |      02:00pm |      10:00 | completed Blotto implementation, debugged almost all the errors using the GMap unit test cases             |

# Collaboration
I did not discuss with anyone. 

# Discussion
Challenges: My biggest challenge was validating all the inputs from stdin so that the program would not crash or have any memory leaks. 
Another challenge was tracking all memory leaks as l wrote many lines of code. Another challenge was integrating my code with the provided 
entry_read function so that my program will handle all invalid inputs without crashing or causing memory issues.
The last challenge was debugging and identifying memory leaks as the code lines became many.
