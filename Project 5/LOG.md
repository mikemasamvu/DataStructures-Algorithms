# Discussion
Challenges: Adapting to C++ syntax presented my primary challenge, but given its similarity to C, the adjustment period was relatively brief. The familiarity with C syntax facilitated a smoother transition, minimizing the learning curve and enabling me to quickly overcome the initial hurdles in grasping C++ intricacies. 
Memory handling: Memory handling in C++ proved seamless, as the language offers enhanced tools for memory management. The ability to use featur like the straightforward memory tracking mechanisms in C++ significantly reduced the complexities associated with memory handling, making it a more manageable aspect of programming in comparison to C.
